For years, Sprout engineering team got by with a scrappy homemade localization solution. While this solution served us for years, we were running into limitations more and more as the team and the application grew. In this post, I will outline some of those limitations and the steps we took to redesign our localization system to address those limitations."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/language-engineering-systems-ingrown/","categorySlug":"/category/engineering-teams/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Language and Engineering systems are ingrown","date":"2020-11-05","category":"Engineering Teams","description":"In some ways we can think about engineering systems in the same way linguists think about natural languages.

That said, turning a rule on for an existing project can be difficult. esplint is a tool that makes it easier to introduce new ESLint rules to large, legacy codebases by tracking, enforcing, and updating file and rule scoped warning counts."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["329091279"],"slicesMap":{}}
